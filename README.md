# Density Sensitivity ML Pipeline

A machine learning pipeline for predicting density sensitivity in chemical reactions using molecular strucuture and Coulomb matrices.

## 🔬 Project Overview

This project implements a complete ML pipeline to predict whether chemical reactions are sensitive to changes in electron density.  
Density-sensitive reactions are those where energy errors are driven by inaccuracies in the electron density, while density-insensitive reactions are those where errors arise primarily from the approximate functional form.

The pipeline integrates physics-based molecular encoding with modern ML techniques:

- **Molecular Parsing** – Reads and parses molecular geometries from `.xyz` files.  
- **Coulomb Matrix Descriptors** – Represents each molecule as a rotation- and permutation-invariant matrix capturing interatomic electrostatic interactions.  
- **Reaction Matrices** – Constructs block-diagonal reaction matrices that account for stoichiometric coefficients of reactants and products.  
- **Spectral Feature Extraction** – Computes and sorts eigenvalues of each reaction matrix to obtain fixed-length, invariant feature vectors.  
- **Learning and Prediction** – Trains **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** models for **binary classification** (density sensitive vs. insensitive).

## 📈 Model Performance


The dataset exhibits a moderate class imbalance (~33% density-sensitive vs. ~67% density-insensitive reactions). Models were evaluated using metrics robust to imbalance, including balanced accuracy, recall, and precision.

### Test set performance of each model at its optimal K\* (number of eigenvalues used)

| Model         | K\* | Accuracy | Balanced Accuracy | ROC-AUC | Recall (Minority) | Precision (Minority) |
|---------------|:---:|:--------:|:-----------------:|:-------:|:-----------------:|:--------------------:|
| **XGBoost**       | 22  | **0.821** | **0.812** | **0.883** | 0.784 | **0.710** |
| **Random Forest** | 22  | 0.801 | 0.791 | 0.864 | 0.763 | 0.679 |
| **Decision Tree** | 24  | 0.808 | 0.806 | 0.825 | **0.804** | 0.678 |
